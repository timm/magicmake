# Installation

1. Download `magic.make` 
   + Place it in the root of your github repo. 
   + Edit that `Makefile` 
     + Rename it to `Makefile`.
     + Write a rule like `timm`, containing your info.
     + Change the `me` rule so it calls your info (and not `timm`)
2. Add the text of `mock.sh` to your `.bash_profile`
